**MyDataSpace** â€“ is a cloud storage of data with ability to access them through the API.

This *MyDataSpace* is similar to [BaaS](http://ru.bmstu.wiki/BaaS_(Backend-as-a-Service)),
like [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), [Parse](https://parseplatform.github.io/) or [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/platform/backend-services).

But unlike BaaS, MyDataSpace allows you to access any data in the system, not just those that the user has uploaded.

This ability is the *MyDataSpace* killer-features!

And thanks to README and full-text search, anyone can find the data they need.
