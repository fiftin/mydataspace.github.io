Open Source continues to capture the world. With the ability to use the code freely,
developers save time and effort, which allowed for the implementation of new ideas.

Unlike code, data remains private. No one wants to share data extracted with such
difficulty.

MyDataSpace helps to make a step to the open data by connecting people over the world.
